 Implemention of a sentiment analysis system based on Big Data for comments from the website HESPRESS.
 
 Implementing a sentiment analysis system for comments from the website HESPRESS is a complex task that involves several steps and technologies. The proposed solution is based on big data technologies and provides a scalable and efficient way of processing large amounts of data in real-time. 
 The first step in the proposed solution is data ingestion, where comments from HESPRESS are fetched using web scraping techniques and stored in a NoSQL database such as MongoDB. This allows for the data to be easily accessible and suitable for further processing. 
 Next, Apache Kafka is used for real-time streaming of the ingested data. Kafka is a popular open-source stream-processing platform that is designed for high-throughput and low-latency data processing. It can handle large amounts of data and ensures that the data is processed in real-time. 
 Apache Spark is used for batch processing of the streamed data. Spark is an open-source big data processing framework that is optimized for performance and can handle large amounts of data in a distributed environment. With Spark, you can easily process and analyze the data in real-time, making it an ideal choice for sentiment analysis. 
 The sentiment analysis is performed using pre-trained models such as NLTK and TextBlob. These libraries provide simple and effective tools for sentiment analysis and are trained on a large corpus of text to perform sentiment analysis. 
 Finally, a real-time dashboard can be created using a tool such as Tableau to visualize the sentiment analysis results. Tableau is a popular data visualization tool that provides interactive and dynamic visualizations and is well suited for real-time data analysis.
 To summarize, to implement a sentiment analysis system based on Big Data for comments from the website HESPRESS, the following solution can be proposed: Architecture: 
 •	Data Ingestion: The comments from HESPRESS can be ingested using web scraping techniques and stored in a NoSQL database such as MongoDB for further processing. 
 •	Streaming: Apache Kafka can be used to stream the ingested data in real-time for processing and analysis. 
 •	Batch Processing: Apache Spark can be used to perform batch processing on the streamed data for sentiment analysis. 
 •	The sentiment analysis can be performed using pre-trained models such as NLTK and TextBlob. 
 •	Dashboarding: A real-time dashboard can be created using a tool such as Tableau to visualize the sentiment analysis results. 
 Tools Used: 
 •	MongoDB for storing the ingested data. 
 •	Apache Kafka for streaming.
 •	Apache Spark for batch processing. 
 •	NLTK and TextBlob for sentiment analysis. 
 •	Tableau  for creating a real-time dashboard.
